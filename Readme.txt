# Market Sentiment vs Trader Performance 

Hey,

This is my submission for the Web3 Data Science Internship assignment. The main goal of this project was to explore how market sentiment â€” like Fear, Greed, Extreme Fear, etc. â€” affects how traders perform. I used two datasets:

- **Historical Trader Data** (trade-level details like PnL, size, side, etc.)
- **Fear-Greed Index** (daily market sentiment classification)

## What's Inside the Project Folder 

- `market_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: My complete notebook with the code, charts, and insights
- `merged_trader_sentiment.csv`: Final dataset after merging both sources
- `pnl_sentiment_boxplot.png`: PnL distribution across sentiments (boxplot)
- `trade_volume_by_sentiment.png`: Bar chart showing total trade volume per sentiment type
- `README.md`: This file you're reading 
- `market_sentiment_analysis.pdf`
---

## A Few Interesting Things I Found 

- Traders tend to trade **heavily during Fear days** â€“ highest volume overall
- The **average profit per trade is highest during Extreme Greed** (small but strong trades)
- **Neutral days show low activity and volatility**, meaning traders may stay cautious
- **Median PnL is zero for all sentiments**, so a few big wins/losses make the difference

## Tools I Used 

- Python + Pandas for data wrangling
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for plotting
- Google Colab for the entire analysis
- Datasets were hosted on Google Drive
